# OpenThrustOS üöÄ  
An Open-Source Operating System for Spacecraft and Rocket Avionics  

## About  
_OpenThrustOS_ is a real-time, open-source operating system designed for modular and autonomous spacecraft control. It provides robust support for avionics, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, making it ideal for open-source rocketry and deep-space missions.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Flight Control**: Optimized for real-time telemetry and decision-making.  
- **Modular Avionics Support**: Compatible with multiple hardware architectures and custom thruster configurations.  
- **Fault Tolerance & Safety**: Adaptive fail-safes and redundancy protocols for high-risk environments.  
- **Ground Station Integration**: Supports telemetry downlink, uplink commands, and mission control interfaces.  
- **Customizable**: Developers can modify and extend features for specific mission needs.

## **How to Start Building OpenThrustOS**  

### **1. Define the Core Objectives**  
Before coding, establish **what OpenThrustOS should do**:  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time control**: Must handle flight dynamics, navigation, and telemetry with minimal delay.  
- ‚úÖ **Modular architecture**: Allow customization for different rockets and spacecraft.  
- ‚úÖ **Hardware compatibility**: Support avionics, microcontrollers, and embedded systems.  
- ‚úÖ **Safety and fault tolerance**: Handle failures gracefully (e.g., redundant systems, watchdog timers).

### **2. Choose the Tech Stack**  

| Component             | Suggested Option(s) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Kernel**           | Custom RTOS / FreeRTOS / RTEMS / Zephyr |
| **Programming Language** | C / C++ / Rust |
| **Processor Support** | ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, x86 (for testing) |
| **Flight Computer** | Raspberry Pi, STM32, ESP32, BeagleBone, custom avionics |
| **Bootloader** | U-Boot (for embedded) or custom firmware |
| **Filesystem** | LittleFS, FAT32, or custom log-based FS |
| **Telemetry & Comms** | CAN Bus, UART, SPI, I¬≤C |
| **Guidance & Navigation** | Kalman filters, sensor fusion algorithms |

For **hardware flexibility**, FreeRTOS or Zephyr are solid choices. For a more hardcore aerospace OS, **RTEMS** (used in NASA missions) is worth considering.

### **3. Set Up Development Environment**  

You‚Äôll need:  
- **Cross-compilation toolchain** (e.g., `arm-none-eabi-gcc` for ARM-based chips)  
- **Emulation for testing** (QEMU, or a physical board like STM32/NXP)  
- **CMake or Makefiles** for build automation  

#### Install the Required Tools  
```
# For ARM development
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi cmake make

# Optional: QEMU for embedded testing
sudo apt install qemu-system-arm
```

---

### **4. Start with a Minimal Kernel**  
To bootstrap **OpenThrustOS**, begin with:  
- ‚úÖ **Bootloader** ‚Äì Set up hardware initialization  
- ‚úÖ **Task Scheduler** ‚Äì Manage real-time tasks  
- ‚úÖ **Driver Layer** ‚Äì Interfaces for sensors, telemetry, and actuators  

#### Minimal "Hello, Rocket!" Kernel  
```
#include <stdint.h>

void kernel_main() {
    while (1) {
        // Placeholder: Perform avionics tasks
    }
}
```
Compile it for an embedded board and flash it!

### **5. Implement Core Features**  
Once the basic kernel runs, add:

#### üöÄ Flight Control System (FCS)  
- **Telemetry logging** (altitude, velocity, acceleration)  
- **Thrust vector control (TVC)** ‚Äì Adjust nozzles dynamically  
- **Sensor fusion** (IMU, GPS, barometer)  
- **Autonomous abort systems** for safety  

#### üì° Communication & Ground Control  
- **CAN Bus / UART communication**  
- **Ground station link** (Wi-Fi, LoRa, or satellite uplink)  
- **Remote firmware updates (OTA)**  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Fault Tolerance  
- **Watchdog Timers (WDT)** ‚Äì Auto-reset if something goes wrong  
- **Redundant control loops** ‚Äì Failover systems  
- **State estimation algorithms** ‚Äì Handle sensor failures  

---

### **6. Create a Simulation Environment**  
Before launching actual rockets, test everything in a **physics simulator**:  
- **JSBSim**: Open-source flight dynamics modeler  
- **Gazebo**: Robot simulation, useful for aerospace  
- **MATLAB/Simulink**: Used in professional aerospace modeling  
- **Custom Python/ROS Sim**: For custom kinematics testing  

#### Example: Simulating a Thruster Test in Python  
```
import numpy as np

thrust = 0  # Initial thrust
for t in range(10):
    thrust += 10 * np.sin(t)  # Simulating thrust oscillations
    print(f"Time {t}s, Thrust: {thrust}N")
```

---

### **7. Build a Community & Iterate**  
üéØ **Publish on GitHub** ‚Üí Share progress, documentation, and roadmap  
üë®‚Äçüíª **Open Issues** ‚Üí Define tasks for contributors  
üìö **Write Docs** ‚Üí Explain architecture and API usage  
üì¢ **Spread the Word** ‚Üí Attract aerospace devs, universities, and space startups

## **Installation**  
Clone the repository and follow the build instructions for your specific hardware:  

```
git clone https://github.com/SeloSlav/OpenThrustOS.git
cd OpenThrustOS
```

### **Building the OS**  
1. Ensure your system has the required dependencies:  
   - GCC or Clang toolchain  
   - CMake (for cross-compilation)  
   - Real-time kernel (if applicable)  

2. Compile the project using:  

   ```
   make build
   ```

3. Flash the OS onto your flight controller or hardware.
