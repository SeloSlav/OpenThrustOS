# OpenThrustOS ðŸš€  
An Open-Source Operating System for Spacecraft and Rocket Avionics  

## About  
_OpenThrustOS_ is a real-time, open-source operating system designed for modular and autonomous spacecraft control. It provides robust support for avionics, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, making it ideal for open-source rocketry and deep-space missions.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Flight Control**: Optimized for real-time telemetry and decision-making.  
- **Modular Avionics Support**: Compatible with multiple hardware architectures and custom thruster configurations.  
- **Fault Tolerance & Safety**: Adaptive fail-safes and redundancy protocols for high-risk environments.  
- **Ground Station Integration**: Supports telemetry downlink, uplink commands, and mission control interfaces.  
- **Customizable**: Developers can modify and extend features for specific mission needs.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and follow the build instructions for your specific hardware:
